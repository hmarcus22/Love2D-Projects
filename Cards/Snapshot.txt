Sounds good. I’ll pause here. Quick snapshot so it’s easy to resume later:

Structure: Core rules moved under src/logic (actions, resolve, round_manager, player_manager, game_initialiser, targeting). DEV_NOTES.md added.
Combat: AOE targeting and damage implemented; health persists; immediate effects on play for Smoke Bomb and Body Slam.
Rounds: KO detection + popup; score increments once; match returns to menu; re-entrancy guard.
Energy/Cost: Favored-tag discount with min cost=1 (no free 1-cost cards).
UI: Current-turn badge/border; higher-contrast board slot outlines; HUD discard removed.
Log: Moved below P2 panel, color-coded + faded, scrollable (wheel + PgUp/PgDn/Home/End), clipped to panel, no overlapping lines. Hover-only wheel scroll is enabled.
Nice-to-do next (when we pick it up):

Apply the log filter in renderer and show “All/Combat/Heals/System” label (toggle already wired to L).
Minor polish: consistent abbreviations in log lines, optional AOEs collapsed per step.
Quick pass on any lingering TODOs (e.g., cost auras, effect grouping).
Ping me when you’re back and I’ll pick up from the log filter rendering.
