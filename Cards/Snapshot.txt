Sounds good. Quick summary of where we landed:

Fighter select: portraits with cover scaling, hover pop + shadow, centered carousel with smooth focus slide; frames and stacking fixed.
Combat log: filter toggles (All/Combat/Heals/Energy/System), header label, filtered scroll bounds.
Cards: auto-load art with cover background, translucent name/stats/description panels for readability.
Hand UI: larger cards, peeked hand with full reveal on hover, smooth lift/scale tween, soft shadow on hover.
Board layout: non-overlapping rows with clamped bottom row; board positions adjusted via config.
Draft phase: choice row near top with hover pop; deck rows left/right, full-size, with hover pop, configurable spacing/offset, and overlap; dedicated draft settings.
Misc: removed duplicate ‘duelist’ card; various layout/config additions.
Whenever you’re ready to pick it back up, we can:

Add wrap/scroll for long draft deck rows.
Add a light glow outline on hand hover or board hover.
Tune text panel opacities or add gradient overlays for card art.
Add draft-specific hover speed/scale.
