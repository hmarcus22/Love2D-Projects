Sounds good — we’ll pause here.
Quick snapshot

Overlay works in Draft and Game with live sliders/checkboxes.
Color controls added (RGBA + swatch) and saved to overrides.
More tunables: draft hover/spacing/bg, hand/hover behavior, glow/panels.
When you’re back, easy next picks

Group/collapsible sections (Draft BG, Layout, Colors) for faster scanning.
Add HUD/resolve tunables (e.g., resolve log lines, HUD panel sizes).
Optional: auto-sync rule changes (e.g., maxHandSize) to current players mid-match.
Per-field reset buttons and a “Save As Preset” flow.
Ping me when ready and I’ll continue from here.
